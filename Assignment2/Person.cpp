/**
 * Person.cpp
 * Implementation of the Person class.
 *
 * This file provides the implementation of the Person class, which includes
 * methods for initializing a person's name and address, and a method for printing
 * the person's details. The Person class is central to demonstrating the usage
 * of composite objects as it incorporates an Address object within it.
